# School Supply Order Tracking – Logic Challenge

# ## Objective
# Students will apply their understanding of lists, nested lists, slicing, sorting, list grouping, and logical decision-making to solve a real-world data organization problem without using code.

# ---

# ## Scenario
# You are helping the main office organize student supply requests for the week. Each request includes:

# - Student name  
# - Item requested  
# - Quantity requested  

# All requests must be stored together in one organized system.

# ---

# ## Student Tasks (No Coding – Logic Only)

# ### 1. Create Student Requests
# Create a collection that stores information for **3 different student requests**.  
# Each student request must include:
# - Student name  
# - Item requested  
# - Quantity requested  


name = input("What is your name? ")
item = input("What is your requested item? ")
quantity1 = int(input("What is the quantity? "))
list1= ([name], [item], [quantity1])
print(list1)
requests2  = []
name = input("What is your name? ")
item= input("What is your requested item? ")
quantity2= int(input("What is the quantity? "))
list2= ([name], [item], [quantity2])
print(list2)
requests3  = []
name = input("What is your name? ")
item = input("What is your requested item? ")
quantity3= int(input("What is the quantity? "))
list3= ([name], [item], [quantity3])
print(list3)
q_list = ([quantity1], [quantity2], [quantity3])
lists = ([list1], [list2], [q_list])
print(list1[0])
print(list3[1])
print(lists[2])


# ---

# ### 2. Identify Key Information
# From your collection:
# - Identify the **first student’s name**
# - Identify the **last student’s requested item only**

# ---

# ### 3. Quantity Extraction
# Create a **separate list that contains only the quantities requested** by the students.

# ---

# ### 4. Order Size Analysis
# Analyze the quantities:
# - If **any quantity is greater than 5**, label the order:
#   “Large order detected!”
# - Otherwise label the order:
#   “Orders within normal limits.”
if quantity1 > 5 or quantity2 > 5 or quantity3 > 5:
    print("Large order detected!")
else : 
    print("Orders within normal limits.")


# ---

# ### 5. Quantity Organization
# Re-organize the quantity list from **smallest to largest** and display the final result.
new_sorted_list = sorted(q_list)

print(f"New ordered quantities: {new_sorted_list}")
# ---

# ## Challenge Extension: Classroom Storage Grid

# You are also given a grid showing classroom supply counts:

# Classroom 1: 8, 12, 5  
# Classroom 2: 7, 3, 9  
# Classroom 3: 10, 6, 4  

# Answer the following:

# 1. What is the **middle number** in the second classroom’s list?
# 2. Create a new list that extracts **only the last number** from each classroom.
# 3. Explain **why this information must be stored as a nested structure instead of a single list.**

# ---

# ## What This Assignment Tests
# - Understanding how grouped data is stored
# - Nested structure reasoning
# - Data extraction using position
# - Organizational logic
# - Real-world decision-making with quantities

# ---

# ## Submission Requirements
# - All answers must be written in words and/or tables.
# - No programming code may be used.
# - Show clear reasoning for each response.

# ---

# ## Academic Integrity
# This is an individual logic and reasoning task. All work must be your own.
